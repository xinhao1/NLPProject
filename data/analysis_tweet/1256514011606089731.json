The answers are given first, and the contestants supply the questions. Three contestants, including the previous show's champion, compete in six categories and in three rounds (with each round's \"answers\" being worth more prize money). In the third round, \"Final Jeopardy,\" the contestants can name their own jackpot -- as long as it's within the amount of money they've already earned. If a player finishes the second round with zero dollars, they are eliminated from \"Final Jeopardy.\" The first version of \"Jeopardy!,\" which aired from 1964 to 1975 on NBC, was hosted by Art Fleming. Alex Trebek began with the program in 1984 (at the start of its syndicated run) and hosted until his death in 2020."}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "799022225751871488", "name": "Donald Trump", "description": "US President Donald Trump"}}, {"domain": {"id": "35", "name": "Politician", "description": "Politicians in the world, like Joe Biden"}, "entity": {"id": "799022225751871488", "name": "Donald Trump", "description": "US President Donald Trump"}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "897487393250344961", "name": "Eric Trump", "description": "American businessman, Donald Trump's son"}}, {"domain": {"id": "29", "name": "Events [Entity Service]", "description": "Entity Service related Events domain"}, "entity": {"id": "1219057585707315201", "name": "COVID-19: Latest news updates from around the world", "description": "This page is a timeline of Tweets with the latest information and updates on COVID-19 from experts, journalists, health authorities and other trusted sources from around the world.
