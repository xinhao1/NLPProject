But it's a broad definition of the arts. Episodes contain interviews with or about popular music acts like Simon and Garfunkel, U2 and the Rolling Stones. But others include a discussion of Van Goh's works or a tribute to playwright Simon Gray. Still others examine topics like the lost art of oratory, the art of stand-up comedy, the music of Rajasthan, the life of photographer Annie Leibovitz or the history of the guitar. It's an eclectic yet artistic mix of topics."}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}], "entities": {"mentions": [{"start": 0, "end": 13, "username": "NoopurRajeMD", "id": "980935198870261760"}, {"start": 14, "end": 25, "username": "JagSinghMD", "id": "3239846883"}], "annotations": [{"start": 82, "end": 90, "probability": 0.9912, "type": "Person", "normalized_text": "Dr. Singh"}], "hashtags": [{"start": 141, "end": 149, "tag": "Covid19"}]}, "in_reply_to_user_id": "980935198870261760", "possibly_sensitive": false, "conversation_id": "1246905651491717122", "text": "@NoopurRajeMD @JagSinghMD Thank you for sharing your experience, Doc! \n\nGlad that Dr. Singh is on the mend and hope your next test comes out #Covid19 Negative!\n Can't imagine how difficult it must have been going through it and sharing it with the world...
