The answers are given first, and the contestants supply the questions. Three contestants, including the previous show's champion, compete in six categories and in three rounds (with each round's \"answers\" being worth more prize money). In the third round, \"Final Jeopardy,\" the contestants can name their own jackpot -- as long as it's within the amount of money they've already earned. If a player finishes the second round with zero dollars, they are eliminated from \"Final Jeopardy.\" The first version of \"Jeopardy!,\" which aired from 1964 to 1975 on NBC, was hosted by Art Fleming. Alex Trebek began with the program in 1984 (at the start of its syndicated run) and hosted until his death in 2020."}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}], "created_at": "2020-04-28T13:46:44.000Z", "source": "Twitter for iPhone", "lang": "en", "text": "@sagarikaghose If it is not jeopardy disease, why don\u2019t you have debate with covid patients at Isolation center \ud83d\ude1d.
