On most detective shows, viewers don't know who committed the crime until the detective pieces the clues together and figures it out. On this programme, however, viewers see the crime unfold at the beginning of most episodes, including who committed the crime. And the mystery for the viewers is trying to spot the clues that will lead Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk) to discover the culprit and the tricks used to get a confession. Episodes of `Columbo' were movie-length and ran sporadically on multiple networks during its run."}}]}
