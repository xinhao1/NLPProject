Repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1; RUNX1; HNF4a; JNK1/c-FOS) were then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting in their effects on gene expression signatures of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents. Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses ", "unwound_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/8/5/129"}], "annotations": [{"start": 55, "end": 64, "probability": 0.3442, "type": "Product", "normalized_text": "SARS-CoV-2"}], "mentions": [{"start": 0, "end": 9, "username": "_atanas_", "id": "2257558088"}, {"start": 10, "end": 20, "username": "m_carmody", "id": "921006266"}]}, "in_reply_to_user_id": "2257558088", "possibly_sensitive": false, "reply_settings": "everyone", "created_at": "2020-06-29T07:21:32.000Z", "public_metrics": {"retweet_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "quote_count": 0}, "text": "@_atanas_ @m_carmody Genomics-guided molecular maps of SARS-CoV-2 targets reveal utility of Vitamin D as efficient inhibitor of COVID-19\nhttps://t.co/DAHm85mL8O \nTripartite combination for prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-19: Vitamin D/Quercetin/Estradiol", "source": "Twitter Web App", "conversation_id": "1265876456279871488", "context_annotations": [{"domain": {"id": "30", "name": "Entities [Entity Service]", "description": "Entity Service top level domain, every item that is in Entity Service should be in this domain"}, "entity": {"id": "854692455005921281", "name": "Science", "description": "Science"}}, {"domain": {"id": "30", "name": "Entities [Entity Service]", "description": "Entity Service top level domain, every item that is in Entity Service should be in this domain"}, "entity": {"id": "847896837532995585", "name": "Biology", "description": "Biology"}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}, {"domain": {"id": "29", "name": "Events [Entity Service]", "description": "Entity Service related Events domain"}, "entity": {"id": "1219057585707315201", "name": "COVID-19: Latest news updates from around the world", "description": "This page is a timeline of Tweets with the latest information and updates on COVID-19 from experts, journalists, health authorities and other trusted sources from around the world.
