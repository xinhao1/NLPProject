Nicholas Brody returns home following eight years in captivity, CIA agent Carrie Mathison thinks he has turned and is connected to a terror plot to be carried out on American soil, so she engages him in a dangerous game of cat and mouse that puts America's national security at risk. Later on, Carrie gets a promotion and returns to the front lines overseas. She is assigned to one of the CIA's most volatile and dangerous stations in the Middle East, where she is in the heart of battle in the war on terror. Years later, after being disillusioned and placing herself in a self-imposed exile in Berlin, Carrie becomes estranged from the CIA, eventually returning stateside where she works for a foundation providing aid to Muslims living in America."}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10029035181", "name": "Homeland"}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10029215522", "name": "Homeland"}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10037018123", "name": "Homeland"}}, {"domain": {"id": "4", "name": "TV Episodes", "description": "Television show episodes"}, "entity": {"id": "10041162007", "name": "New Normal"}}], "created_at": "2015-12-07T03:08:50.000Z", "referenced_tweets": [{"type": "replied_to", "id": "673615400655970304"}], "conversation_id": "673615400655970304", "entities": {"mentions": [{"start": 1, "end": 15, "username": "DRUDGE_REPORT", "id": "14887069"}, {"start": 110, "end": 123, "username": "JudgeJeanine", "id": "29458079"}, {"start": 124, "end": 130, "username": "greta", "id": "16031927"}], "urls": [{"start": 85, "end": 108, "url": "https://t.co/D903lpKb1c", "expanded_url": "http://drudge.tw/1N5fVFm", "display_url": "drudge.tw/1N5fVFm"}]}, "in_reply_to_user_id": "14669951", "public_metrics": {"retweet_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "quote_count": 0}, "source": "Twitter for iPad", "text": "\u201c@DRUDGE_REPORT: SHOCK:  72 'Homeland Security' Employees on Terrorist Watch List... https://t.co/D903lpKb1c\u201d @JudgeJeanine @greta", "id": "673700666720808961", "reply_settings": "everyone"}
