Heading up the graveyard shift (an appropriate term in this case) is supervisor D.B. Russell, who is a `Left Coast' Sherlock Holmes who devours crime novels. The members of Russell's team include Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle (the team's moral compass), Greg Sanders and Morgan Brody. The team works closely with Capt Jim Brass, a seasoned detective who is a protector of CSI - sometimes to a fault. Previous heads of the group include Gus Grissom and Dr Raymond Langston."}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "1055164712357220352", "name": "Tomi Lahren", "description": "Tomi Lahren"}}, {"domain": {"id": "94", "name": "Journalist", "description": "A journalist like 'Anderson Cooper'"}, "entity": {"id": "1055164712357220352", "name": "Tomi Lahren", "description": "Tomi Lahren"}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}], "reply_settings": "everyone", "public_metrics": {"retweet_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "like_count": 1, "quote_count": 0}, "source": "Twitter Web App", "id": "1262374272397389826", "referenced_tweets": [{"type": "replied_to", "id": "1262212085821341701"}], "text": "@TomiLahren You should get straight on to the CSI:COVID19 Taskforce and hand over all your evidence ... and it sounds like you have loads (\ud83e\udd2d) .... \n\nDo it for your Country sweetie ...", "author_id": "73826119", "possibly_sensitive": false, "created_at": "2020-05-18T13:27:34.000Z"}
