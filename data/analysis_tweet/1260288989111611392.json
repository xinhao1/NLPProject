It all started when his best friend, Marshall, drops the bombshell that he plans to propose to longtime girlfriend Lily, a kindergarten teacher. Suddenly, Ted realises that he had better get a move on if he hopes to find true love. Helping him in the quest is Barney, a friend with endless - often outrageous - opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to meet women. When Ted meets Robin, he is sure it's love at first sight, but the affair fizzles into friendship. Voice-over by Bob Saget (`Full House') tells the story through flashbacks."}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}], "created_at": "2020-05-12T19:21:24.000Z", "source": "Twitter for Android", "lang": "en", "text": "@CarterBays In the other timeline Hillary died of COVID-19 three months ago", "public_metrics": {"retweet_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "like_count": 5, "quote_count": 0}}
