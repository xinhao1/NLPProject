The family includes loving, blue-haired matriarch Marge, troublemaking son Bart, overachieving daughter Lisa and baby Maggie. Other Springfield residents include the family's religious neighbour, Ned Flanders, family physician Dr Hibbert, Moe the bartender and police chief Clancy Wiggum."}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10028414416", "name": "Os Simpsons"}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10029190505", "name": "Live: NBA Basketball", "description": "Live coverage from the National Basketball Association, the top basketball league in North America."}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10029304530", "name": "NBA Basketball"}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10029697719", "name": "The Simpsons"}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "819538676380102656", "name": "Shane Dawson", "description": "Shane Dawson"}}, {"domain": {"id": "58", "name": "Entertainment Personality", "description": "An entertainment personality in the world, like Anderson Cooper or Miranda Sings"}, "entity": {"id": "819538676380102656", "name": "Shane Dawson", "description": "Shane Dawson"}}, {"domain": {"id": "120", "name": "Digital Creator", "description": "Influencers who create content on digital platforms"}, "entity": {"id": "819538676380102656", "name": "Shane Dawson", "description": "Shane Dawson"}}], "created_at": "2020-05-07T03:11:50.000Z", "conversation_id": "1258233050128961536", "entities": {"hashtags": [{"start": 5, "end": 18, "tag": "mattgroening"}, {"start": 108, "end": 120, "tag": "TheSimpsons"}, {"start": 121, "end": 138, "tag": "ConspiracyTheory"}, {"start": 139, "end": 151, "tag": "shanedawson"}, {"start": 152, "end": 160, "tag": "COVID19"}, {"start": 161, "end": 169, "tag": "hornets"}], "urls": [{"start": 170, "end": 193, "url": "https://t.co/TbXYmlXMF4", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/Nandos_vlogs/status/1258233050128961536/video/1", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/TbXYmlXMF4"}]}, "public_metrics": {"retweet_count": 1247, "reply_count": 110, "like_count": 4165, "quote_count": 161}, "source": "Twitter for iPhone", "attachments": {"media_keys": ["7_1258232981233287168"]}, "text": "BROO #mattgroening The gigs up, we know you\u2019re a Time Traveler!! \ud83d\ude12 we have hella questions just Speak out! \n#TheSimpsons #ConspiracyTheory #shanedawson #COVID19 #hornets https://t.co/TbXYmlXMF4", "id": "1258233050128961536", "reply_settings": "everyone"}
