Four contestants, all of whom are seated in one of the wildest audiences in daytime game-show history, are called to the stage to play a preliminary pricing round. That winner joins the host on stage for one of more than 70 different pricing games. After three such games, the contestants spin a big wheel -- hoping to get as close to $1 as possible -- in the \"Showcase Showdown.\" That's repeated in the second half of the show, and two highest winners of that round advance to the final, where prizes could be cars or roomsful of furniture. Models present the prizes."}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "10040395078", "name": "Joe Biden", "description": "US President Joe Biden"}}, {"domain": {"id": "35", "name": "Politician", "description": "Politicians in the world, like Joe Biden"}, "entity": {"id": "10040395078", "name": "Joe Biden", "description": "US President Joe Biden"}}], "id": "1278766318674677768", "conversation_id": "1278747263439794178", "source": "Twitter for Android", "entities": {"mentions": [{"start": 0, "end": 9, "username": "JoeBiden", "id": "939091"}]}, "public_metrics": {"retweet_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "like_count": 1, "quote_count": 0}, "created_at": "2020-07-02T19:03:43.000Z", "referenced_tweets": [{"type": "replied_to", "id": "1278747263439794178"}], "lang": "en", "possibly_sensitive": false, "reply_settings": "everyone", "author_id": "825497831570079745"}
