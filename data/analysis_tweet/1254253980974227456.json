There's Jim, the likable employee who's a bit of an every man. Jim has a thing for receptionist-turned-sales-rep Pam -- because office romances are always a good idea! There's also Dwight, the co-worker who is successful but devoid of social skills and common sense."}}, {"domain": {"id": "47", "name": "Brand", "description": "Brands and Companies"}, "entity": {"id": "1105122215241048065", "name": "TMZ", "description": "TMZ"}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "852770154656047104", "name": "Kim Jong-un", "description": "North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un"}}, {"domain": {"id": "35", "name": "Politician", "description": "Politicians in the world, like Joe Biden"}, "entity": {"id": "852770154656047104", "name": "Kim Jong-un", "description": "North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un"}}], "conversation_id": "1254103393481527296", "author_id": "1197692735983104000", "possibly_sensitive": false, "id": "1254253980974227456", "in_reply_to_user_id": "16331010"}
