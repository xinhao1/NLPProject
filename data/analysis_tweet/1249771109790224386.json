It all started when his best friend, Marshall, drops the bombshell that he plans to propose to longtime girlfriend Lily, a kindergarten teacher. Suddenly, Ted realises that he had better get a move on if he hopes to find true love. Helping him in the quest is Barney, a friend with endless - often outrageous - opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to meet women. When Ted meets Robin, he is sure it's love at first sight, but the affair fizzles into friendship. Voice-over by Bob Saget (`Full House') tells the story through flashbacks."}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10028286388", "name": "C\u00f3mo Conoc\u00ed a Vuestra Madre"}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10029190317", "name": "How I Met Your Mother"}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "806573039584354304", "name": "Jimmy Fallon", "description": "Jimmy Fallon"}}, {"domain": {"id": "58", "name": "Entertainment Personality", "description": "An entertainment personality in the world, like Anderson Cooper or Miranda Sings"}, "entity": {"id": "806573039584354304", "name": "Jimmy Fallon", "description": "Jimmy Fallon"}}], "source": "Twitter for iPhone"}
