We analyze the numbers of infected people in selected eleven countries (Japan, USA, Russia, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia, Spain,South Korea, UK, and Sweden). By using the double exponential function called the Gompertz function, f G ( x ) = exp(\u2212 e \u2212 x ), the number of infected people is well described as N ( t ) = N f G ( \u03b3 ( t \u2212 t )), where N , \u03b3 and t are the final total number of infected people, the damping rate of the infection probability and the peak time of dN ( t )/ dt , respectively. The scaled data of infected people in most of the analyzed countries are found to collapse onto a common scaling function f G ( x ) with x = \u03b3 ( t \u2212 t ) in the range of f G ( x ) \u00b1 0.05. The recently proposed indicator so-called the K value, the increasing rate of infected people in one week, is also found to show universal behavior.
