Martin's best-selling book series `A Song of Ice and Fire' is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its considerable storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic.

Martin is credited as a co-executive producer and one of the writers for the series, which was filmed in Northern Ireland and Malta."}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10028727706", "name": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "907355784366850053", "name": "Muhammadu Buhari", "description": "President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari"}}, {"domain": {"id": "35", "name": "Politician", "description": "Politicians in the world, like Joe Biden"}, "entity": {"id": "907355784366850053", "name": "Muhammadu Buhari", "description": "President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari"}}, {"domain": {"id": "29", "name": "Events [Entity Service]", "description": "Entity Service related Events domain"}, "entity": {"id": "1219057585707315201", "name": "COVID-19: Latest news updates from around the world", "description": "This page is a timeline of Tweets with the latest information and updates on COVID-19 from experts, journalists, health authorities and other trusted sources from around the world.
