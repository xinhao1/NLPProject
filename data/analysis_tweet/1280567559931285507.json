Here, we argue that Simpson's paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretations\u2014potentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by reviewing results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, clinical psychology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered\u2014including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's p", "unwound_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00513/full"}, {"start": 202, "end": 225, "url": "https://t.co/iaNQPMXEfF", "expanded_url": "http://mls.io/paradoxsamedata", "display_url": "mls.io/paradoxsamedata"}, {"start": 301, "end": 324, "url": "https://t.co/6uGIHVJKPh", "expanded_url": "http://mls.io/spainsarscov2", "display_url": "mls.io/spainsarscov2"}, {"start": 342, "end": 365, "url": "https://t.co/YaeYLiZZSA", "expanded_url": "http://mls.io/airspreadsvirus", "display_url": "mls.io/airspreadsvirus"}, {"start": 366, "end": 389, "url": "https://t.co/dknzOBpwCL", "expanded_url": "http://mls.io/dreducevirus", "display_url": "mls.io/dreducevirus", "images": [{"url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1491118477914288129/Z_Z7mZyW?format=png&name=orig", "width": 160, "height": 160}, {"url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/news_img/1491118477914288129/Z_Z7mZyW?format=png&name=150x150", "width": 150, "height": 150}], "status": 200, "title": "Evidence that Vitamin D Supplementation Could Reduce Risk of Influenza and COVID-19 Infections and Deaths", "description": "The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not.
