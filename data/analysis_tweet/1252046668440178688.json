That resulted in a stunning portrait of one of the sport's most iconic athletes and a celebrated team. ``The Last Dance'' follows the Bulls' 1997-98 season from start to finish, while also covering the rest of the chapters in Jordan's remarkable career. The 10-part docuseries follows the Jordan timeline from when he was an emerging star on his high school team to becoming a worldwide marketing force and cultural figure. The series takes its name from a phrase coined by then-Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who knew that the season would likely be the final run for the core members of that 1990s Bulls dynasty."}}, {"domain": {"id": "4", "name": "TV Episodes", "description": "Television show episodes"}, "entity": {"id": "1247457812445138947", "name": "The Last Dance", "description": "Photo via @ESPN"}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "799022225751871488", "name": "Donald Trump", "description": "US President Donald Trump"}}, {"domain": {"id": "29", "name": "Events [Entity Service]", "description": "Entity Service related Events domain"}, "entity": {"id": "1247457812445138947", "name": "The Last Dance", "description": "Photo via @ESPN"}}, {"domain": {"id": "35", "name": "Politician", "description": "Politicians in the world, like Joe Biden"}, "entity": {"id": "799022225751871488", "name": "Donald Trump", "description": "US President Donald Trump"}}, {"domain": {"id": "45", "name": "Brand Vertical", "description": "Top level entities that describe a Brands industry"}, "entity": {"id": "781974597310615553", "name": "Entertainment"}}, {"domain": {"id": "46", "name": "Brand Category", "description": "Categories within Brand Verticals that narrow down the scope of Brands"}, "entity": {"id": "781974596157181956", "name": "Online Site"}}, {"domain": {"id": "46", "name": "Brand Category", "description": "Categories within Brand Verticals that narrow down the scope of Brands"}, "entity": {"id": "781974597105094656", "name": "TV/Movies Related"}}, {"domain": {"id": "47", "name": "Brand", "description": "Brands and Companies"}, "entity": {"id": "1065657279150665728", "name": "Fox News", "description": "Fox News"}}], "public_metrics": {"retweet_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "quote_count": 0}, "id": "1252046668440178688", "lang": "en", "text": "@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews So #IMPOTUS45 you will have test kits available + PPE for all that need them BEFORE this grand \"reopening\"?\n\nOr... is it ok if just a \"few\" more ppl sicken / die, so your #GOPGenocide #TRUMPGENOCIDEFORPROFIT can get Wall St. sacred bulls running?
