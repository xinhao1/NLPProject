It all started when his best friend, Marshall, drops the bombshell that he plans to propose to longtime girlfriend Lily, a kindergarten teacher. Suddenly, Ted realises that he had better get a move on if he hopes to find true love. Helping him in the quest is Barney, a friend with endless - often outrageous - opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to meet women. When Ted meets Robin, he is sure it's love at first sight, but the affair fizzles into friendship. Voice-over by Bob Saget (`Full House') tells the story through flashbacks."}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "799022225751871488", "name": "Donald Trump", "description": "US President Donald Trump"}}, {"domain": {"id": "35", "name": "Politician", "description": "Politicians in the world, like Joe Biden"}, "entity": {"id": "799022225751871488", "name": "Donald Trump", "description": "US President Donald Trump"}}, {"domain": {"id": "123", "name": "Ongoing News Story", "description": "Ongoing News Stories like 'Brexit'"}, "entity": {"id": "1220701888179359745", "name": "COVID-19"}}, {"domain": {"id": "10", "name": "Person", "description": "Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"}, "entity": {"id": "10037721440", "name": "Hillary Clinton", "description": "Former First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton"}}, {"domain": {"id": "35", "name": "Politician", "description": "Politicians in the world, like Joe Biden"}, "entity": {"id": "10037721440", "name": "Hillary Clinton", "description": "Former First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton"}}, {"domain": {"id": "30", "name": "Entities [Entity Service]", "description": "Entity Service top level domain, every item that is in Entity Service should be in this domain"}, "entity": {"id": "839159814991167489", "name": "Travel", "description": "Travel"}}, {"domain": {"id": "66", "name": "Interests and Hobbies Category", "description": "A grouping of interests and hobbies entities, like Novelty Food or Destinations"}, "entity": {"id": "839160129752686593", "name": "General Travel", "description": "General Travel"}}, {"domain": {"id": "67", "name": "Interests and Hobbies", "description": "Interests, opinions, and behaviors of individuals, groups, or cultures; like Speciality Cooking or Theme Parks"}, "entity": {"id": "839161975712067584", "name": "Travel Actions", "description": "This entity includes all conversations about travel and vacation."}}], "created_at": "2020-05-13T07:05:26.000Z", "source": "Twitter Web App", "lang": "en", "text": "@CarterBays @RomeVanLara23 COVID19 would have probably been much deadlier under Hillary, Trump hasn\u2019t done a good job but atleast he cutoff travel from China while Democrats called it xenophobic", "public_metrics": {"retweet_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "quote_count": 0}}
